### What is this? 

This is a game balance simulator. It is used in order to simulate resources 
gained/lost over periods of time in order to figure out good numbers to use for
your mechanics. 

For example, how much experience should each enemy give to control the rate of
leveling up?

How will the character level affect the amount of damage various abilites will
do?
